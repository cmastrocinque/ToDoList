# ToDoList
My first todo list using heroku and mongodb.

The website is hosted at https://boiling-taiga-45869.herokuapp.com/

Checkmarking a task will delete its contents from the todo list.

Adding a path to the url will direct you to a page with a unique todo list. The first 3 tasks are default items and will be present for all new todo lists.

Ex. https://boiling-taiga-45869.herokuapp.com/newday
Will direct you to a new page with a todo list titled "Newday" and each task will be saved for this unique new todo list.
